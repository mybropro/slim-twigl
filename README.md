## Shader Viewer

The goal of this project is to be a lightweight viewer for shader code generated by thinks like (twigl.app)[https://twigl.app] or (Shadertoy)[https://shadertoy.com]. Both of these projects have some use in shader code golf, ie the making of cool shaders with compact code.

This project is a stripped down version of the (twigl)[https://github.com/doxas/twigl] focusing on just viewing shaders. There is still support for using the code editor.
